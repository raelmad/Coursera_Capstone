Introduction

New York, the city of dreams, of music, of cultural mix, of races, of opportunities for people and for companies. A city that is home to places as emblematic as the United Nations, where the different races, languages and thoughts of the entire planet are reflected.

A city where within its racial diversity there is an important Latino and Hispanic community. According to a recent report published by the New York City Council, Dominicans are the largest immigrant community, followed by Chinese and in third place by Mexicans.

Information from New York City Council states that in 1970 the percentage of foreign population in the city was 18%. Today this percentage has risen to 37%. If we look at the figures, the estimated population of New York this year is 8,175,000, of which 3,024,000 are foreigners.

Of this foreign population, 380,000 are Dominican (12.57%); 350,200 are Chinese (11.58%) and 186,300 are Mexican (6.16%). Jamaicans are in fourth place with 169,200 (5,602 %) and Guyanese with 139,900 (4.63 %).

As for the Spanish community, according to the figures provided by the Spanish Consulates General in the United States, the total number of Spaniards registered in January 2020 is 180,625, compared to 170,971 in 2019, of whom 42,930 are from Spain.

Spain is synonymous with many words: history, culture, fiesta and gastronomy. Spanish food is one of the most valued. The ratings received from diners all over the world exceed the notable ones, with figures that do not go below 4 out of 5 in any case, according to the latest study recently made public by the TripAdvisor platform.
